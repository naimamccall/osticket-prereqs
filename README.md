To utilize remote desktop you will need a unique IP address. I chose to use one through the Azure portal in order to experience the features of a Windows computer on my Macbook. Creating a virtual machine in Azure is as simple as asigning it a recourse group, region, zone, image (copy of OS, software and data that will be used in the virtual machine), along with a username and password.

Once a unique IP address has been established it is time to copy that IP address so that it can be used for remote desktop.

For those who are Windows computer users already, these tasks can be done on Windows Remote Desktop. Mac users can complete these tasks via the Windows App. Once the application is opened, by clicking the + sign in the top right corner, the option to create a new PC will pop up. Clicking on that will prompt information to be entered, allowing the virtual machine to mirrored on the PC being created.
